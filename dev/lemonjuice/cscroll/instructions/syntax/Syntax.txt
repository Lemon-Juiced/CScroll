CScoll Language Syntax

CScroll is a language based on a "tape", that a pointer scrolls across. The data at the points in this tape can be
manipulated when the pointer is hovering over them. The data by default at all of these points are saved as an integer.
CScoll is JScroll 2.0 where JScroll's compiler was built in Java, CScoll's compiler is built in C/C++.

Pointer Move Instructions:
< Move Left
> Move Right

Pointer Interaction Instructions:
+ Increment
- Decrement
. Store In Pointer Memory (Default is 0)
* Add Pointer Memory To Current Pointer Location
/ Subtract Pointer Memory To Current Pointer Location

Pointer Print Instructions:
# Print As Integer
@ Print As Character

Conditional Logic Instructions:
All conditional logic is proceeded by a '_' to inidicate that it is conditional logic.
Conditional logic sits on the tape and involves 3 points.
Example (i0, i1, i2) i0 gets compared to i2, the result is stored as a 0 (false) or 1 (true) in i1.
_<< Less Than
_>> Greater Than
_<= Less Than Or Equal To
_>= Greater Than Or Equal To
_== Equal To
_!= Not Equal To

Current Ideal Loop Instructions:
( Start Loop
) End Loop
% The Value Stored in the Pointer
Syntax 1 (%,{file_location_of_cscroll_file_to_loop})
Syntax 2 ({number_of_iterations},{file_location_of_cscroll_file_to_loop})
Whenever a loop is run, the contents of the loop are placed into the pointer's memory.

Misc. Instructions:
^ Print A Newline Character
'{char}' Override Print char
"{String}" Override Print String
& Print Current Tape
$ Print Current Tape With Spaces
; End Program
